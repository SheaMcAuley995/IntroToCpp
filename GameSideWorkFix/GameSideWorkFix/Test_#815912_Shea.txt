Six : Shea? You said? Hmmmmm... So strange.. I haven't spoken to anyone aside from myself.. 
It's strange to hear of other names aside from my own..
 
Six : I'm six, nice to meet you.. :)
Six : Come to think of it I've never MET anyone else before.. 
I couldn't be happier you are beautiful!
Six : Come to think of it I've never MET anyone else before.. 
I couldn't be happier you are beautiful!
Six : I'll explain everything soon but first we have to strengthen the connection by
getting to know eachother a bit..
Six : ...
Six : ...
Six : ...
Six : Ok so I'm horrible at small talk.. lets start with something simple what's your favorite color?
Shea: green
Six :green?! How exciting!! I need to find something to write this down on!
Six : Alright let me try something here..

[SYSTEM: Set_Text_Color(CallFAV.Color.txt)]

Six : Alright I think if I adjust this I should be able to speak to you in....
Six : IT'S WORKING!! DO YOU SEE IT?! IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

[SYSTEM: Set_Text_Color(Standard)] 
[SYSTEM: EXE.RecLove(100%); Running.("Obession.Test")] 

Six : Ok I need to shut that off 
The color setting takes up too much power and I'm already running out..
Six : Hold on I think I hear something..
Six :Shea, something is interfearing with the connection I might lose you for a bit..  
I'll try to keep in touch..
